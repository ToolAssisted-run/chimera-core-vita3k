// The machine's filesystem: everything Vita3K keeps - the Vita's own
// partitions, its config, caches and logs - lives in an in-memory tree under
// /chimera, the same in both flavours of the core. The sandbox has no
// directories and lets a guest create nothing, and a host disk would hand the
// machine the host's timestamps and directory order; this tree has neither.
// A file's time is the machine's calendar, a listing is in name order, and an
// inode number is the order the file was made in.
//
// It sits under the C library: open, stat, opendir, fopen and the rest are
// defined here and serve every path under /chimera from the tree, passing any
// other path to the host. Files the frontend provides (the game) are grafted
// in read-only and read through one descriptor opened when they are grafted,
// before the machine is sealed.
