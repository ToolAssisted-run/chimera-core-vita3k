# Generates both halves of the GPU bridge (build/generated-gl) from miniBox's
# master list, for every name glad 2's header knows. Vita3K's renderer loads
# its entry points through FrameHost::get_proc_address, which is the bridge's
# lookup, so the install step's assignments to glad's own pointers are taken
# out: they would tie the wrappers to one glad's globals, and Vita3K's glad
# (1) is not the one the host half uses (2).
